# US Housing Market Trends Analysis (2018–2026)

## Project Title
**US Housing Market Trends: Exploring Key Drivers, Risks, and Forecasts**

## Why I Chose This Project
As someone passionate about both analytics and real estate, I wanted to explore the deeper story behind U.S. home values and what truly drives them. This project gave me the opportunity to apply real-world data skills to a topic with direct social and economic impact. It also challenged me to combine various public datasets, clean and model them, and transform them into actionable insights.

## About This Project
This project explores trends in U.S. home values using Zillow housing data enriched with economic and environmental indicators (e.g., income, unemployment, taxes, and disasters). The project spans from 2018 to 2026 (including a 3-year forecast), with focus on:
- Identifying factors that influence home price shifts.
- Tracking value trends across top 50+ metro areas.
- Forecasting future prices using economic trends.
- Comparing cities and uncovering vulnerabilities like tax burden, median income, unemployment rate etc.

The final result is an interactive Power BI dashboard and supporting presentation for both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Technologies Used
- **Python (Jupyter Notebooks):** Data cleaning, merging, feature engineering, forecasting (Prophet, Linear Regression).
- **APIs:** FRED (income, unemployment, population), FEMA (weather disasters).
- **Power BI:** Visual analytics dashboard, DAX measures, KPIs, drilldowns.
- **Excel:** Preliminary exploration and formatting.
- **GitHub & Google Slides:** Project documentation and presentation.

## Capstone Details
This is my **Capstone Project** for the **Part-Time Data Analytics Bootcamp at Nashville Software School (July 2025 Graduate)**. It represents the culmination of months of training in data wrangling, analysis, visualization, and storytelling.
